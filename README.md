# Itai's Declassified Physics Survival Guide
If you get the repository name reference...respect.

These are some (hopefully) helpful pieces of advice for university physics students expecially those who are interested in computer programming and the problems it allows yo to solve. Everything here is my opinion but I think it's general enough to be valid.

## General Advice
Before I jump into the technical stuff, I want to give some general tips that I wish I knew before I went to university. These are applicable for all students, not just physics ones.

 - #### Get a good set of tupperwares...trust me
 - #### Never buy cheap bin bags.
 - #### Never feel you have to go out partying every night, you will meet people either way.
 - #### Talk to your lecturers; you will learn more and get inside info on things you may be able to work on.
 - #### Sautee some Peperami, add baked beans and reduce to taste...you're welcome (sorry vegie people).

 ## Advice for Those Interested in Programming

 You will probably have noticed that computer programming is a useful skill in pretty much every field of research and throughout industry. The first few sub-sections are about specific tools that I think everyone interested in programming should learn. After these, there are sub-sections about particular fields within programming.

 ### Command Line
 Being able to use the command line will allow you to move around your file system and programm more effectively than using a graphical file explorer.

 ### GitHub
 The fact that you are reading this at all, means that you have already used one of the most useful and widely used tools in the world of programming, GitHub. This is a place where programmers put their code, it is used to track the development of the code (version control). 

 ### Git
 Git is a tool use mainly on the command line to track changes to files and interface with remote code repositories (like GitHub). You should definitely learn at least the basics of Git.

 ### Text Editors
 To write code, you need a text editor. There are many on offer. Three big ones are:

  - **VScode:** One of the most popular text editors in the world with a huge plugin ecosystem.

  - **Vim:** A command line based editor. I recommend learning how to use Vim even if you are not going to use it as your main editor as you can quickly edit files right on the command line.

  - **NeoVim:** An offshoot of Vim which is more actively developed. I would highly recommend NeoVim if you are fairly comfortable using the command line.
