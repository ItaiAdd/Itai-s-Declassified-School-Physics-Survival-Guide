# Advice for Physics Students
If you get the repository name reference...respect.

These are some (hopefully) helpful pieces of advice for university physics students expecially those who are interested in computer programming and the problems it allows yo to solve. Everything here is my opinion but I think it's general enough to be valid.

## General Advice
Before I jump into the technical stuff, I want to give some general tips that I wish I knew before I went to university. These are applicable for all students, not just physics ones.

 - #### Get a good set of tupperwares...trust me
 - #### Never buy cheap bin bags.
 - #### Never feel you have to go out partying every night, you will meet people either way.
 - #### Talk to your lecturers; you will learn more and get inside info on things you may be able to work on.
 - #### Sautee some Peperami, add baked beans and reduce to taste...you're welcome (sorry vegie people).
